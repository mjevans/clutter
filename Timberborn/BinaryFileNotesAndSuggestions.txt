 Initial notes 2021-10-14:

 Please :FIXME:

 Format oddities / incompatibilities ("GameVersion" : "v20211008-31c08af-sw")
  - some floats are emitted oddly, E.G. {"Rotation":{"X":-.,"Y":-.,"Z":-.,"W":1.0}} << This faults even more lax parsers.
    // sed -i 's/:-./:0.0/g' # store as 0.0 not -.
  - STUPIDLY long lines, mostly caused by no newlines ever, serializing 'image' like blob maps as single strings, emit a newline after each object would be best / easy?
 
 Review of the largest blobs and sections in the current JSON files.
 
  "Entities" is a _large_ array of many different entities on the map, each of which follows a different template.
  - Base entity values could greatly benefit from representation in a fixed binary (stored struct) format. This is contrasted by the variability of subkeys which are all optional.
  - Very common entities might be factored out to binary lists.  E.G. Trees (Birch, Pine, Maple AKA 'log'), Berries, Crops (Carrot, Potatoes, Wheat), Path, Levee, continue to look for low hanging fruit.
  - Sort by entity type to improve compression by localizing similar subkey names (smooth entropy changes)
  - Possibly just factor all of the required elements together...
    - Before: 218 len
    {"Components":{"BlockObject":{"Coordinates":{"X":41,"Y":40,"Z":4}},"Constructible":{"Finished":true},"ConstructionSite":{"BuildTimeProgressInHoursKey":1}},"Id":"8622d7cb-7ca5-4b29-bb90-d019285ce61f","Template":"Slope"}
    - After: 160 len implicit Blockobject(X,Y,Z),Id,Template,{... array of extra object data ...}
    {41,40,4,"8622d7cb-7ca5-4b29-bb90-d019285ce61f","Slope",{"Components":{"Constructible":{"Finished":true},"ConstructionSite":{"BuildTimeProgressInHoursKey":1}}}}
  ALL the tile arrays should be stored as binary blobs in 'raw' arrays
    - To improve compression planes and rectangles made by players should be more likely to clump together, similar to images in a video codec. (power of 2)
      -  16 = 4x4   probably too small to improve compression, but might be considered
      -  64 = 8x8   gut feeling this is likely to be the sweet spot for the maps I've seen
      - 256 = 16x16 probably too large to yield gains over just line-scanning the map
    - MapSize should be stored in the (compressed?) header, before the arrays, it provides an implicit size for the arrays and reduces data duplication
      - Are non power of 2 sizes supported or desired in the future?
      - It's still reasonable to store as 2 x 32-bit numbers to be future proof? Everywhere?
      - 'TerrainHeights' appears to have a very small, positive, integer range.
        - It's fine to store it as either uint8 or sint8.
        - If the range is required to be 0-15 inclusive packed nibbles might be worth the bit shifts for really large maps.
      - 'SoilMoistureSimulator' looks like a single precision float array
      - 'WaterDepths' looks like a a singleprecision float array
      - 'Outflows' 4 cardinal directions per tile, still looks like a (4x larger) a single precision float array
        - This should still use the same 'base' tile group size from the other maps
        - That would also help if it matches the in-game representation of the world.
      - 'PlantingMap' s
        - shouldn't re-store the game's map size
        - SHOULD be a bitfield / bit vector; one of the other reasons to use a 64 (8x8) square is a 64 bit word would also match that bitfield nicely, let the compilers figure out how to optimally index.
  - Some areas use double precision floats (8 bytes) where single precision would readily be sufficient... E.G. offset of an object or rotation.
       
  A great deal of the non-entity structure that isn't a 'tile blob' could be stored flattened among a typed series of key:value entries, though implementing that is likely very low priority, adding some reserved space for it seems like a good idea at the time.  At runtime they're probably stored in a hash/map/dict anyway, so sorting in the file (nor during serialization) is required.

 
  Proposed binary format:
  (Also see https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/dev/doc/zstd_compression_format.md )

  Instead of a magic number, a human recognizable (self-documenting) raw byte array replaces the 'magic number' and provides data for file and similar magic fingerprint databases. https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/en/man1/file.1.html https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/en/man5/magic.5.html

 Addition 2021-10-17:

 Observation notes:

 - ArrTree is a subset of ArrGrowable, but that's less obvious in the JSON

 - Many of the floats do not need to be 32 bit single precision floats.

 A full float / double might work better at runtime for math and GPU usage.  A fixed precision integer would factor out portions of the float that aren't useful for the expected data.

 mrmrDiameterScale / HeightScale appear to have a range of roughly 0.8 to 1.2  A numeric range of 0.4
 uint8_t could represent 0.4/256 has a step-size of 0.00156 (3~4 decimal precision places)
 uint16_t ~= 0.4/65536 ~= 0.00000610356 (5~6 decimal precision places)

 For storage (and initial creation should round trip the storage and recall functions to pre-apply the lossy compression) the more limited precision 8 bits of fraction offers the range seems more than sufficient for object scale data.

// The results can also be packed and bit/shifted if fragmentation is required.  E.G. a uint16_t could temporarily store 0:4095 or 0:16383 and store within a bitfield fragment of the correct size.

// uint8_t precision range  = (uint8_t)((INPUT - 0.8) * 256.0 / 0.4) ; ->> (OUTPUT_t)(((double)(FILE_V)) / 256.0 * 0.4 + 0.8)
#DEFINE packIntFraction(IN, IN_BASE, IN_RANGE, OUT_T, OUT_RANGE) (OUT_T)((IN - IN_BASE) * IN_RANGE / OUT_RANGE)
#DEFINE unpackIntFraction(MEM_T, MEM_BASE, MEM_RANGE, FILE_V, FILE_RANGE) (MEM_T)(((double)(FILE_V)) / FILE_RANGE * MEM_RANGE + MEM_BASE)

#DEFINE packFileNrmr(IN) packIntFraction(IN, 0.8, 0.4, uint8_t, 256)
#DEFINE unpackFileNrmr(FV) unpackIntFraction(float /-:FIXME:-/, 0.8, 0.4, FV, 256)
